<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><span class="ss">MACRAME</span> <span class="smaller"><span class="ssn">General Instructions</span></span></span></h2>
<p><span class="ss">EQUIPMENT:</span> T-pins. Scissors. Tape
measure or ruler. Knotting board
(brown paper marked off in one inch
squares for gauge. Place over
knotting board of Celotex, cork, or
padded cardboard). Rubber bands for
bobbins (wind lengths overhand,
secure with rubber band and release
as needed). 1-yarn needle.</p>
<p><span class="ss">KNOTTING:</span> 1. Keep the foundation
yarn secure and in place by using
T-pins in the overhand knot at either
end. 2. Keep leader taut and straight
on an angle or parallel to the
foundation yarn. 3. Tie knots tightly
to cover leader. 4. Secure with pins to
keep accurate measurement. (Use the
one inch squares as a gauge.)</p>
<p>Learn all knots on sample piece before
beginning, making sure to acquire the
right tension. This will enable you to
identify the knots.</p>
<p>Five knots are used in this booklet.
They are basically the same differing
mainly in direction. 1. Reversed
Double Half Hitch (R D H H) as shown
in <a href="#fig1">figure #1</a>, used for mounting
lengths onto foundation yarn. Fold
length in half, tuck looped end over
foundation yarn and pull toward you,
tuck loose ends into loop and tighten.
2. Overhand Knot (O H K) as shown in
<a href="#fig2">figure #2</a>. Hold length in left hand,
with right hand bring it up and over
towards the left through loop formed,
tighten. 3. Vertical Half Hitch (V H H)
as shown in <a href="#fig3">figure #3</a>. Hold one
length in left hand, with right hand
bring next length around and between
the two lengths (counts as one knot).
Bring left length around right and
between the two lengths. Continue for
the number of knots indicated. 4.
Diagonal Double Half Hitch (D D H H)
as shown in <a href="#fig4">figure #4</a>. Working from
left to right, the leader (length on
which the knots are tied) is held in the
right hand. Each length is knotted onto
it in the same manner as the first knot
of the V H H two times. The leader is
held taut and on a downward angle.
Working from right to left the leader
is held in the left hand. 5. Horizontal
Bar or Horizontal Double Half Hitch
(H B or H D H H) as shown in <a href="#fig5">figure #5</a>. Holding the leader taut and
parallel to the foundation yarn work
as D D H H.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
