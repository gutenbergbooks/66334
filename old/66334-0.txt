                      MACRAME General Instructions


EQUIPMENT: T-pins. Scissors. Tape measure or ruler. Knotting board
(brown paper marked off in one inch squares for gauge. Place over
knotting board of Celotex, cork, or padded cardboard). Rubber bands for
bobbins (wind lengths overhand, secure with rubber band and release as
needed). 1-yarn needle.

KNOTTING: 1. Keep the foundation yarn secure and in place by using
T-pins in the overhand knot at either end. 2. Keep leader taut and
straight on an angle or parallel to the foundation yarn. 3. Tie knots
tightly to cover leader. 4. Secure with pins to keep accurate
measurement. (Use the one inch squares as a gauge.)

Learn all knots on sample piece before beginning, making sure to acquire
the right tension. This will enable you to identify the knots.

Five knots are used in this booklet. They are basically the same
differing mainly in direction. 1. Reversed Double Half Hitch (R D H H)
as shown in figure #1, used for mounting lengths onto foundation yarn.
Fold length in half, tuck looped end over foundation yarn and pull
toward you, tuck loose ends into loop and tighten. 2. Overhand Knot (O H
K) as shown in figure #2. Hold length in left hand, with right hand
bring it up and over towards the left through loop formed, tighten. 3.
Vertical Half Hitch (V H H) as shown in figure #3. Hold one length in
left hand, with right hand bring next length around and between the two
lengths (counts as one knot). Bring left length around right and between
the two lengths. Continue for the number of knots indicated. 4. Diagonal
Double Half Hitch (D D H H) as shown in figure #4. Working from left to
right, the leader (length on which the knots are tied) is held in the
right hand. Each length is knotted onto it in the same manner as the
first knot of the V H H two times. The leader is held taut and on a
downward angle. Working from right to left the leader is held in the
left hand. 5. Horizontal Bar or Horizontal Double Half Hitch (H B or H D
H H) as shown in figure #5. Holding the leader taut and parallel to the
foundation yarn work as D D H H.




Asterisk...*. This indicates that the directions immediately following
are to be repeated the given number of times in addition to the ones
already given. Thus “repeat from * 3 times” means 4 patterns in all.

  Note: All lengths are worked with 2 strands unless otherwise noted.

Cut two 6½ yd lengths and twelve 4 yd lengths of A, eight 4 yd lengths
each of B, C and D. The belt will be worked in two halves, each half
measuring 12 inches, then sewn together. Take one 6½ yd length of A,
fold in half, find center and tie an OHK 2 inches from either side of
center. Secure 4 inch center to board and anchor lengths onto it using
RDHH in the following sequence: 4 A (including the longer length of 4
inch section), 2 B, 2 C, 4 D, 2 C, 2 B, 4 A. Cross center 4 D lengths
over one another having 2 lengths to the right and 2 to the left. Work
each length in DDHH leaving lengths used as leaders untied so that the
last knot is 1 inch below foundation (first row shaping only). Repeat
with each color working half in each direction until A lengths remain in
the center. Starting on the left, * with D tie 8 VHH, with C tie 7, with
B tie 3, with A tie 2, with A tie 3 *. Repeat between *’s in reverse.
Using outside D length on right, work HDHH to left across entire piece
and using same length as leader work back to right. With outside D on
the right work to center in DDHH so that last knot is 1 inch below HB.
Repeat with outside D on the left. With these 2 leaders in the center
tie 3 VHH. Work these leaders in opposite directions forming an X with
last knot 1 inch below center of X. With left outside D work a HB across
the entire piece. Using same length as leader work back to the left.
Starting on the left * with D tie 8 VHH, with C tie 7, with B tie 3,
with A tie 3, with A tie 2 *. Repeat between *’s in reverse. Cross
center A lengths over each other having four to the left and four to the
right. Carry each length to the outside in DDHH being sure not to tie
any lengths used as leaders, so that last knot is 2 inches below last HB
worked. Carry all lengths in the same manner until D remains in the
center. Starting at left * with A tie 11 VHH, with A tie 7, with B tie
5, with C tie 4 *. Divide the 4 lengths of D into 2 lengths having 4
strands each, tie 3 VHH. Repeat between *’s in reverse. With left
outside A work a HB across entire piece to the right. Using same length
as leader work back to the left. Starting 2 inches below last bar
worked, with right outside A work a HB across entire piece to the left.
Using same length as leader work back to the right. With outside 2 A
lengths on either side tie 8 VHH. Divide the center D lengths into 4
lengths having 2 strands each. Tie 8 VHH with first 2 lengths of D and 8
VHH with next 2 lengths of D. These will be used to form the lacing
loops. Sew ends of loops into position. With yarn needle or crochet hook
weave in the ends on the back side for at least ½ inch. Trim.

PATTERN:

** Starting with the first A on the left as a leader, work in HDHH to
the right across the entire piece including the last 13 yd. length. With
last length knotted as leader work in HDHH to the left across the entire
piece. Starting at the left, the first 6 lengths of A will be worked to
form an angle <. With the 6th A in from the left as leader work to the
left in DDHH having the last knot 1 inch below the last HB worked. With
the same length as leader work to the right in DDHH so that the last
knot is 2 inches below last HB worked. NOTE: Work all angles to
correspond with this in size. The next color group will be worked to
form a diamond <>. Divide D having 1 strand of yarn to a length. These
will remain this way throughout work. Work left D strand to the left in
DDHH and back to the center forming an angle <. Work right D strand to
the right in DDHH and back to the center forming an angle >. * The next
6 lengths of A will be worked to form an angle >. With the first A as a
leader work in same manner as the first group of A reversing direction.
The next 12 lengths of A will be worked to form an X. With first length
as leader work in DDHH to center, knotting each of the next 5 lengths.
With last of 12 lengths as leader work to the left, to the center,
knotting each of the next 5 lengths. With the 2 leaders knot 3 VHH and
carry leaders in opposite directions forming the X. Divide the next 3
lengths into 2 lengths of 3 strands each. These will remain this way
throughout work. Tie 7 VHH. Work the next 12 lengths to form an X. Work
the next 6 lengths in the same manner as the first group of 6 forming an
angle < *. The center color group (next 20 lengths) will be worked to
form an X. With first C length as leader work in DDHH to the center.
With first C on the right as leader work in DDHH to the center. With the

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
